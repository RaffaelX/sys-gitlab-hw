========================================================================
Some Important Notes!
 1. The file encryption appears to have completed successfully, however,
    cryptouser MUST LOGIN IMMEDIATELY, _BEFORE_THE_NEXT_REBOOT_,
    TO COMPLETE THE MIGRATION!!!
 2. If cryptouser can log in and read and write their files, then the migration is complete,
    and you should remove /home/cryptouser.rjiC8Ikt.
    Otherwise, restore /home/cryptouser.rjiC8Ikt back to /home/cryptouser.
 3. cryptouser should also run 'ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase' and record
    their randomly generated mount passphrase as soon as possible.
 4. To ensure the integrity of all encrypted data on this system, you
    should also encrypt swap space with 'ecryptfs-setup-swap'.
